                  I created Sanitize because, like many others, I struggle with distractions and information overload
                  online. I wanted a tool that would allow me to customize my browsing experience and focus on what
                  truly matters. Hopefully, Sanitize can help you achieve the same.

                  Absolutely not! Everything runs locally because user privacy is a top priority for Sanitize. The
                  extension does not collect or track your browsing data or activity in any way. It only requires the
                  bare minimum set of permissions to function properly. You have complete control over what information
                  websites can access while using Sanitize.
