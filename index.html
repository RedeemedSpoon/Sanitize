                  Identify what elements distract you the most and block or remove them. Experiment with different
                  features to create a focused and streamlined browsing experience. Use "Zen Mode" for a text-only view
                  and "Grayscale Mode" to minimize visual clutter, for your personal needs.

                  Zenify is currently being developed by a single anonymous developer, me. I am passionate about
                  creating tools that empower users and improve the online experience. While I work on it alone for now,
                  I hope to see the project grow with the help of the community.

                  Absolutely not! Everything runs locally because user privacy is a top priority for Zenify. The
                  extension does not collect or track your browsing data or activity in any way. It only requires the
                  bare minimum to function properly. You have complete control over what information websites can access
                  while using Zenify.

                  I created Zenify because, like many others, I struggle with distractions and information overload
                  online. I wanted a tool that would allow me to customize my browsing experience and focus on what
                  truly matters. Hopefully, Zenify can help you achieve the same.

                  Zenify is currently available for major browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera. Coming
                  support for other browsers, such as Safari, is very unlikely to happen. Meanwhile, forks such as
                  LibreWolf, may not function correctly.

                  For a more secure and focused online journey, consider these tips: combine Zenify with privacy-focused
                  extensions like uBlock Origin and Canvas Blocker, use a FOSS browser like Firefox, explore
                  privacy-oriented search engines like DuckDuckGo, and cultivate mindful browsing habits by setting time
                  limits and avoiding distractions For better OPSEC.
