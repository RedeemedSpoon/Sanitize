                  I created Sanitize because, like many others, I struggle with distractions and information overload
                  online. I wanted a tool that would allow me to customize my browsing experience and focus on what
                  truly matters. Hopefully, Sanitize can help you achieve the same.

                  Sanitize is currently available for major browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera. Coming
                  support for other browsers, such as Safari, is very unlikely to happen. Meanwhile, forks such as
                  LibreWolf, may not function correctly.
