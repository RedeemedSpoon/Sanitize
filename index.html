                reload the website by pressing Ctrl + Shift + R to clear the cache. Otherwise, if this does not work,

                Zen mode is not meant to be used on every website because it will likely pick up junk text or nothing of
                interest, so be careful with it. Plus, if you use other settings, such as blocking images or disabling
                Css, it will greatly increase the load time of the webpage you are viewing and will likely cause
                performance issues.

              <li>
                Element selection when adding new filters will not work on some websites, such as YouTube.com, because
                of some nonsense and bloat issues. If that is the case, then consider picking the element yourself by
                using the browser console (F12) and writing the Css selector to the text area.

              <li>
                After you opened the popup to add a new filter but did not create one and closed the popup, you will
                have to reload the website to get back all the removed Js, event listeners, and links to continue your
                browsing. This allows us to carefully pick the element you clicked on without activating any event or

                Js previews permanently affect the DOM; this means that if you remove an element from your code in the

                  Identify what elements distract you the most and block or remove them. Experiment with different

                  Absolutely not! Everything runs locally because user privacy is a top priority for Sanitize. The
                  extension does not collect or track your browsing data or activity in any way. It only requires the
                  bare minimum set of permissions to function properly. You have complete control over what information
                  websites can access while using Sanitize.
